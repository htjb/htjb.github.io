I am a second year PhD student in Physics at Cavendish Astrophysics,
University of Cambridge. I work on data analysis techniques for global 21-cm cosmology
as part of the
[Cm-Wave Experimental Radio Cosmology](https://cavendishcmwavecosmology.weebly.com/) group at Cambridge and as part of the
[REACH (Radio Experiment for the Analysis of Cosmic Hydrogen)]('https://www.astro.phy.cam.ac.uk/research/research-projects/reach/reach')
collaboration under the
supervision of Dr Eloy de Lera Acedo, Dr Will Handley and Dr Anastasia Fialkov.
During the first year of my PhD I have looked primarily at the
modelling of foregrounds with Maximally Smooth Functions (MSFs) and related
functions. MSFs are functions which feature no zero
crossing high order derivatives and are consequently smooth in nature. This makes them
ideally suited for modelling smooth synchrotron and
free-free emission foregrounds in 21-cm experiments. I am also interested in the use of
MSFs for the identification of non-smooth/periodic
systematics in 21-cm cosmology experiments. I am the lead author and maintainer of the
code [maxsmooth](https://github.com/htjb/maxsmooth) which can be used to rapidly
and efficiently fit MSFs.

More recently I have worked on novel techniques for emulating the global (or sky-averaged)
21-cm signal with neural networks. The resultant signal emulator
[globalemu](https://github.com/htjb/globalemu) will be used extensively by the
REACH collaboration for physical signal modelling in a nested sampling loop.

I am currently looking at potential applications of both [maxsmooth](https://github.com/htjb/maxsmooth)
and [globalemu](https://github.com/htjb/globalemu) to real data sets.

I am currently a Junior Kavli Fellow at the Kavli Institute for Cosmology at the University of Cambridge and a 
Post-Doctoral Research Associate at St Edmunds College. My research focuses on developing 
novel Bayesian analysis tools and applying them to various cosmological studies.

During my PhD, I specialized in data analysis techniques for global or sky-averaged 21-cm cosmology as 
part of the [Cm-Wave Experimental Radio Cosmology](https://cavendishcmwavecosmology.weebly.com/) group 
and the [REACH (Radio Experiment for the Analysis of Cosmic Hydrogen)](https://www.astro.phy.cam.ac.uk/research/research-projects/reach/reach) collaboration 
under the guidance of Dr. Eloy de Lera Acedo, Dr. Will Handley, and Dr. Anastasia Fialkov.

You can find my thesis [here](https://github.com/htjb/Thesis/blob/main/Thesis.pdf).

I have published several research papers on topics such as calibrating Bayesian tension statistics, 
emulator development for the global 21-cm signal, and the application of Normalizing Flows in Bayesian workflows. 
[My work](https://harrybevins.co.uk/work.html) has been featured in prestigious journals such 
as Nature Astronomy and the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society.

Feel free to get in touch via email (htjb2@cam.ac.uk) if you have questions about
my work or would like to collaborate

During my academic career, I have had the privilege of supervising multiple PhD, Masters, and undergraduate students in 
the field of astrophysics and cosmology. I have guided students in data analysis techniques for 21-cm cosmology, 
calibration methods for cosmological experiments, and theoretical modeling of astrophysical signals. 
I have also lectured on topics such as data-driven radio astronomy, Bayesian inference, and simulation-based inference for astrophysics and cosmology.

I have organized and participated in various conferences, workshops, 
and panel discussions, contributing to the advancement of knowledge and collaboration within the scientific community.

You can read more on my [CV](https://github.com/htjb/CV/releases/download/Current/CV.pdf) and you can
see the various talks and lectures I have given [here](https://github.com/htjb/Talks).

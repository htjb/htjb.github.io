I am a final year PhD student in Physics and a Research Assistant at Cavendish Astrophysics,
University of Cambridge. 
During my PhD I worked on data analysis techniques for global or sky-averaged 21-cm cosmology
as part of the
[Cm-Wave Experimental Radio Cosmology](https://cavendishcmwavecosmology.weebly.com/) group and as part of the
[REACH (Radio Experiment for the Analysis of Cosmic Hydrogen)](https://www.astro.phy.cam.ac.uk/research/research-projects/reach/reach)
collaboration under the
supervision of Dr Eloy de Lera Acedo, Dr Will Handley and Dr Anastasia Fialkov.

I will be starting as a Junior Kavli fellow at the Kavli Institute for Cosmology
Cambridge from September 2023.

21-cm cosmology is a field of study which aims to track the redshifted 21-cm
emission from neutral hydrogen throughout cosmic history in an effort to
determine when the first galaxies formed and what those galaxies were like. We know
very little about the first luminous objects to form between the CMB and the current
era of the galaxies dominated by large scale structure. While probes like JWST
can in principle probe distant galaxies, as far back as z=20, 21-cm cosmology can
provide statistical information about the population of galaxies over the redshift range
z = 5 - 150.

While a promising probe the view to the first
galaxies is fogged by emission from our own and other galaxies, emission from our own atmosphere
and made challenging by the non-uniform responses of our instruments. I have worked on a
number of these challenges during my PhD including; galactic and extragalactic foreground modelling using maximally smooth
functions (see [maxsmooth](https://github.com/htjb/maxsmooth)), signal emulation 
(see [globalemu](https://github.com/htjb/globalemu)) improving on the runtime of the state of the
art emulators by a factor of 102 and the application of Normalizing Flows in 
a machine-learning enhanced Bayesian workflow (see [margarine](https://github.com/htjb/margarine)).


You can read about the application of the tools I have developed to data from SARAS2 [here](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/513/3/4507/6575926),
data from SARAS3 in [Nature Astronomy](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-022-01825-6) and data from 
HERA and SARAS3 [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.03298).

I have recently worked on a novel approach for learning multi-modal probability distributions with
Normalizing Flows which you can read about [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02930).

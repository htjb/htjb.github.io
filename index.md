I am a third year PhD student in Physics at Cavendish Astrophysics,
University of Cambridge. I work on data analysis techniques for global 21-cm cosmology
as part of the
[Cm-Wave Experimental Radio Cosmology](https://cavendishcmwavecosmology.weebly.com/) group and as part of the
[REACH (Radio Experiment for the Analysis of Cosmic Hydrogen)]('https://www.astro.phy.cam.ac.uk/research/research-projects/reach/reach')
collaboration under the
supervision of Dr Eloy de Lera Acedo, Dr Will Handley and Dr Anastasia Fialkov.
During the first year of my PhD I have looked primarily at the
modelling of foregrounds with Maximally Smooth Functions (MSFs) and related
functions. MSFs have very smooth properties making them
ideally suited for modelling smooth synchrotron and
free-free emission foregrounds in 21-cm experiments. They can also be used as
a tool to help identify non-smooth systematics in data sets. I am the lead author and maintainer of the
code [maxsmooth](https://github.com/htjb/maxsmooth) which can be used to rapidly
and efficiently fit MSFs.

More recently I have worked on novel techniques for emulating the global (or sky-averaged)
21-cm signal with neural networks. The resultant signal emulator
[globalemu](https://github.com/htjb/globalemu) will be used extensively by the
REACH collaboration for physical signal modelling in a nested sampling loop.

I have recently applied [maxsmooth](https://github.com/htjb/maxsmooth)
and [globalemu](https://github.com/htjb/globalemu) to data from the SARAS2 experiment
to provide constraints on the Epoch or Reionization. You can read about this work
[here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11531).

Currently, I am working on applications of similar techniques to other data sets
and investigating the use of Normalizing flows in the Bayesian analysis workflow.

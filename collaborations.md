## REACH

I am a member of the Radio Experiment for the Analysis of Cosmic Hydrogen
collaboration. The collaboration aims to detect the sky-averaged 21-cm signal from the
Cosmic Dawn using a dipole antenna based in the Karoo Radio Reserve
in South Africa. I have been a memeber of the collaboration since 2019
and work on the development of data analysis and calibration pipelines
as well as instrumentation and theory.

The collaboration is led by Prof. Eloy de Lera Acedo and Prof. Dirk de Villiers
and include researchers from across Europe, India and South Africa.

## CosmoCube

I am also a memeber of the CosmoCube collaboration which is aiming to detect
the sky-averaged 21-cm signal from the Dark Ages using a lunar orbiter.
